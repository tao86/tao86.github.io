## Where to start?

First of all - shout out to Chad Baldwin with this [post](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) showing
how to setup a simple blogging platform within GitHub. 

I'm still not sure what I want to accomplish with this, so I think I will just start by posting about various techy projects I am
currently working on for fun at home - and maybe throw in some stuff I come across at work.

Or maybe I should start with an actual name for the blog..
